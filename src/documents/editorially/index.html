<h1 class="pageHeadline">My name is Lynn Fisher.</h1>
<h2 class="pageSubhead--main">I am a designer, HTML/CSS developer, and aspiring writer.</h2>
<h2 class="pageSubhead--main">I would love to work at Editorially.</h2>
<hr />
<h2 class="pageSubhead">A little about me.</h2>
<p>I first started making websites in high school, teaching myself HTML and CSS as a hobby. You can imagine the type of site a teenager in the early 00's might produce, but nevertheless, I was hooked. I studied fine arts in college, but spent a great amount of time designing and perfecting my table-based layouts.</p>
<p>After graduation I started with meltmedia, an interactive agency in Tempe, Arizona. I quickly discovered how little I knew and how much there was to learn. For the next six years, I studied and practiced as an HTML/CSS developer, UI designer, and most recently as the designer/dev for their dedicated R&amp;D team.</p>
<p>I spend most of my day solving problems internally for meltmedia and externally for our clients. My work is especially rewarding, knowing my effort is spent making things better for those around me. I love designing and developing for the web. Every day there is something new to learn and amazing teams are putting out inspirational work.</p>
<h2 class="pageSubhead">Things I value.</h2>
<p><strong>Working with great people.</strong> People are everything. With different perspectives and backgrounds, we constantly teach and learn from each other.</p>
<p><strong>Less is more.</strong> Let's strive for simplicity and clarity in our work and everyday lives.</p>
<p><strong>But more can be delightful.</strong> Our work should not only be clear, it should be a joy for those who receive and participate in it.</p>
<p><strong>Having fun along the way.</strong> We are so lucky to do what we do. Always be grateful and don't take things too seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Be good.</strong> Be good at what we do and be good to those around us. The things we put into the world should make it better.</p>
<h2 class="pageSubhead">Why Editorially?</h2>
<p>Editorially is a small team of insanely talented and caring individuals, working together on a product for collaboration around the written word. It gets my blood pumping thinking about being a part of that. If we should surround ourselves with smart and inspirational people, Editorially is the place I'd like to be. It is a product I'm excited about and I would love to help shape its future.</p>
<p>I believe I can make an impact. Although I specialize in HTML and CSS, I keep a holistic view. I care just as much about accessibility and performance as I do about business requirements and UI look and feel. I am thoughtful with design and markup, aiming to provide the best experience for users and those around me.</p>
<p>Ever since I saw Ethan Marcotte speak at An Event Apart three years ago, I've been in love with responsive design. I've seen the relationship between content, design, and development deepen. Not only are they critically intertwined, but they combine to produce results much better than ever before.<p>
