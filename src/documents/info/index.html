        <h1>Rynn Fisher <span>Artist &#38; Designer</span></h1>
        <p>I came to this great nation when I was only 11 months old and was shot out of a t-shirt cannon across the Pacific. I settled in Scottsdale, Arizona where, in kindergarten, I won my very first art contest. I was off to a good start.</p>
        <p>In high school, between pop-punk shows in the Nile basement, I taught myself HTML and made my very first website: a fansite for a local band I stalked, I mean liked.</p>
        <p>Later I attended Arizona State University where I slowly decided I didn't want to be a computer animator and discovered a love for painting. I also fell in love with garlic flavored pizza crust, but that's another tale.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 2007, I somehow got a job at <a href="http://meltmedia.com" target="_blank" title="meltmedia">meltmedia</a> where I now focus my time on designing for the web, making decisions in the browser, and improving communication between designers and developers.</p>
        <p>I now live in Chandler with my shy, but insanely funny husband Clay and our two dogs, Boomer and Helo.</p>
        <p class="footnote">Also: chillax, Mom. It's just butterbeer.</p>
