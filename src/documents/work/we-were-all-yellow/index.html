        <p class="projectDetail-desc"><em>We Were All Yellow</em> was my senior Honors thesis project on Asian stereotypes in America. I surveyed several Caucasians about what they picture when they think of Asian people. These were the most common answers I was given. It's meant to be light-hearted, poking fun at our cultural differences and perceptions.</p>
