        <p>I was adopted when I was a baby and my mother always jokes that my brother and I were her best and most expensive purchases. I prefer the joke about being ordered, packed in a box, and shipped to the U.S. Along those lines, Instababies Technology, Inc. was born. It's the new adoption solution. Purchase the gender you want, add water, and watch your family grow.</p>
