        <p class="projectDetail-desc">My brother and sister-in-law had a sweet backyard wedding in March of 2011. With being thrifty in mind, they asked me to design their save the dates, invitations, and wedding website. They had a fun, laid-back style for the event and awesome engagement photos by their friend, budding photographer Andrew Westover.</p>
